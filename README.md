# sharpcoin
Prove of work type of blockchain which issues coins to those who solve blocks.

This repository contains code in c# and is called the Core. The Core will function as the backend of the coin. It manages
the blockchain, communicates with other nodes and offers an api through pipes.

This coin is inspired by [Naivecoin](https://github.com/conradoqg/naivecoin) and therefore also a naive implementation.
